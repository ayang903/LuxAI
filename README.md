# Lux AI Challenge üçÑ üéÆ DS598 Spring 2024

Team Gamma: Andy Yang, Wai Yuen Cheng, Tariq Georges

## Introduction
Our team approached this challenge by leveraging a U-Net-based neural network, specifically
designed to process spatial data and prioritize relevant information through skip connections. The
network was trained on replay data generously shared by the original competition-winning team, Toad Brigade. We also integrated our own replays, from Team GO and Team Q of our DS598 class tournament.
By analyzing and learning from this high-quality data, our model aimed to replicate and improve
upon the successful strategies employed by the winning team. 

## Train and test for yourself
The training data can be downloaded from the battle records of the 1st team _Toad Brigade_. You can also download different teams' episodes from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).  
For training, you can run train.py.
For testing the agent's performance, please follow the instructions in this [Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stonet2000/lux-ai-season-1-jupyter-notebook-tutorial/notebook).  

## Result
Finally our team ended in fourth place, losing third place on the final day. Our highest obtained score was 1937.2.
Our agent trained with U-Net has become a smart game player!
